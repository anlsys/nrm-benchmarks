* Compilation: 
- use the ./compile script
- check the compiler, and provide a path for OpenBLAS
- the script compiles both algorithms: "cg" and "bicgstab"

* Launching:
- use the launch script
- the kernel name must be provided as an input to the script: either "cg" or "bicgstab"
- parameters are already set by default:
	_ argument 1: size of the matrix: impacts the duration of a single iteration (larger 
	matrix size = longer iteration time)
    _ argument 2: conditionning of the matrix: impacts the total execution time (good 
	conditionning = quick convergence, poor condionning = longer convergence)
	_ argument 3: LOG variable to display the residual for each iteration

* Current default parameters performances:
- the A matrix and B vector are always the same and do not include random values
- the convergence criteria is hard-coded in both algorithms (note that a smaller value
  would lead to a longer total execution time)
- launching CG with a matrix size of 1000 with a poorly conditionned matrix:
	_ total execution time                        = 21.8s (on Intel Core i9-11980HK, machine dependent)
	_ total number of iterations                  = 401 (deterministic)
	_ signals per second (1 iteration = 1 signal) = 19.3
- launching BiCGStab with a matrix size of 1000 with a poorly conditionned matrix:
	_ total execution time                        = 16.06s (on Intel Core i9-11980HK, machine dependent)
	_ total number of iterations                  = 157 (deterministic)
	_ signals per second (1 iteration = 1 signal) = 9.8
